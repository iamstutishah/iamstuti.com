I created this website as a way to showcase my current and finished projects. It was created using JavaScript, CSS and HTML with React as a library. 

Some updates that I would like to do in the future include:
- Add a preloader everytime the site is refreshed
- Add a dark mode because the website is only light right now and I'm blinded
- Redirection of each demo link
